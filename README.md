# Default GitHub Organisation Repo 

For **OpenFABR**, we use GitHub's `.github` repo to organise the open source development and engage with the community. That includes:

- Community health files (mostly in the root of the repo)
- Templates (mostly in `/.github` directory)
- Organisation profile page (in `/profile` directory)

As any changes in this repo likely affect all FABR-sponsored OSS work on GitHub, please use <open@fabr.ltd> to make suggestions on changes you should make here.
